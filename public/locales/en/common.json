He not only translates design into code with precision but also gets genuinely involved in the process, always questioning, suggesting, and collaborating to reach the best solution. He's someone who is always attentive to details and seeks to understand the product context. Additionally, his proactivity and partnership with the team make work much more fluid and productive.

A curious and interested professional with the impact of his work for the business, he stands out for his commitment and character in face of challenges. As a Product Owner, I consider Rafa exceptional in terms of communication and could count on his collaboration not only in code but also in refining tasks and User Stories, facilitating the team's work. Although he has positively demonstrated his adaptability in startup environments, I bet he will soar in more mature and structured contexts ðŸš€"

It was his first job as a programmer, and he quickly stood out for his attention to detail (this is very important for frontend), being the design team's favorite when it comes to making exactly like Figma. And more, always questioning design decisions to reach a better, simpler, and more cost-effective final result! He quickly adapted to technologies he didn't yet master like Ruby on Rails and Vue.js, and also showed great skill with those he already knew better like React. This guy has a lot of potential ahead! Success!"
